# 10K_Visualizer
Project to visualize SEC Documents based on novel information and overlaps in content within company filings and between companies over time.

Currently able to pull in a list of CIKs and Tickers, parse out sentences, and then mark each sentences as being new or old based on the text of previous filings.
